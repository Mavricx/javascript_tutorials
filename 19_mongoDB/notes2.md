## mongo relationships
MongoDB relationships refer to how documents are related to one another within a database. There are three main types of relationships:

1. **One-to-One**: A single document is related to one other document.
2. **One-to-Many**: A single document is related to multiple documents.
3. **Many-to-Many**: Multiple documents are related to multiple other documents.

These relationships can be implemented using embedded documents or references.
